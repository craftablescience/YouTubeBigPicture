# YouTube Big Picture

**An application that runs YouTube from Steam Big Picture.**
The method used has some serious limitations, but I don't know how to fix them. If you do, feel free to shoot me a PR!

## To Use
Download the latest release at the right side of the page, and unzip the file. Then go into Steam, and click the "Add Game" button.
You want to add a non-Steam game. Browse for the executable you downloaded and select it. There you go!

Before starting the application, you should also apply the generic Keyboard Game controller config in the game settings.
You'll probably still need a keyboard to type, unless I'm dumb and forgot the controller combination to open the keyboard.
